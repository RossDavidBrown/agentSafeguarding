This prototype has been used to test our end to end journey in Alpha phase.
It is broken down in different journeys based on our personae and user roles. 
You will find the instruction to walk through each journey in the index.html file.
As such all the patterns and components are still a work in progress but you can use this prototype as a starting point to work on similar journeys. <br></br>
Contents of the prototype:
<ul>
  <li>Whitney: Report an incident </li>
  <li>Sartaq: Add witness report </li>
  <li>Sarah: Give recommendations</li>
  <li>Sadiq: Make a decision </li>
